# Game of Life - Parallel Implelemntation

This was a project for a Parallel Algorithms course done in pair with a colleague. It shows 4 parallel implementations of Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton.

1. Implement thread based synchronization using Locks, Semaphor and Condition
2. Implement thread based synchronization using message passing Queue
3. Implement process based synchronization using message passing Queue
4. Implement process based synchronization using a process Pool by dividing the grid into N subsets of cells
